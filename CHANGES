Changes incorporated in Rev B:

1) D84 - Swap with 0R link > Now 0805 0R link

2) Fit Resistor links to R168, R170, R172. > 0R parts fitted (no change to layout)

3) Lift legs, pin 5 and pin 8 on U21, U20, U19 and U18. > Swapped pins 5 to 8 ( there was an inversion on all RS485 pins, A, B, Y and Z.)

4) U35 and U36 - connect pins 2-8 on each chip > pin 8 (STBY) connected to ground.

5) Ensure LAN EPPROM (U45) is blank.

6) Program Sata EPPROM

8) SATA Reset U37, Pin 4 - consider adding reset circuitry to Sata chip and link option to master reset line > Added reset circuit

9) Fit series 0R links and decoupling caps (0402) on all data lines just before the connectors for the RS485


10) Fit ferrite bead and filter cap close the power supply connectors and on the front panel where it leaves
the box, to help remove unwanted noise.

11) Ensure ground of HDMI connector is main ground and not earth ground.

12) Add spare EPPROM to main motherboard.

13) Move adjustable power connectors so they don't clash with backplane

14) Add pull up to 1 wire header, J8

15) Added R251 (47K) and change R203 from DNP to 24K.

Mods required to Rev B:

a) Swap R8 for a 360R part. (-5V regulator fix)

b) Remove R186 and fit 0R 0603 part to R94. (enable global reset on Sata device)

c) Ensure R168, R170 and R172 have been fitted (0402 0R links) - These were missed by the Contract Manufacturer on the last build batch.
