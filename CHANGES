*********************************
Changes incorporated in Rev B:
*********************************

1) D84 - Swap with 0R link > Now 0805 0R link

2) Fit Resistor links to R168, R170, R172. > 0R parts fitted (no change to layout)

3) Lift legs, pin 5 and pin 8 on U21, U20, U19 and U18. > Swapped pins 5 to 8 ( there was an inversion on all RS485 pins, A, B, Y and Z.)

4) U35 and U36 - connect pins 2-8 on each chip > pin 8 (STBY) connected to ground.

5) Ensure LAN EPPROM (U45) is blank.

6) Program Sata EPPROM

8) SATA Reset U37, Pin 4 - consider adding reset circuitry to Sata chip and link option to master reset line > Added reset circuit

9) Fit series 0R links and decoupling caps (0402) on all data lines just before the connectors for the RS485


10) Fit ferrite bead and filter cap close the power supply connectors and on the front panel where it leaves
the box, to help remove unwanted noise.

11) Ensure ground of HDMI connector is main ground and not earth ground.

12) Add spare EPPROM to main motherboard.

13) Move adjustable power connectors so they don't clash with backplane

14) Add pull up to 1 wire header, J8

15) Added R251 (47K) and change R203 from DNP to 24K.

*********************************
Changes incorporated in Rev C:
*********************************

1) Swap R8 for a 360R part. (-5V regulator fix)

2) Remove R186 and fit 0R 0603 part to R94. (enable global reset on Sata device)

3) Ensure R168, R170 and R172 have been fitted (0402 0R links) - These were missed by the Contract Manufacturer on the last build batch.

4) Move backplane connector to right hand side by 1mm to fix alignment issue on HILTOP chassis

5) Add an integrated low pass filter (e.g. NUF6401 or similar) in series with the SD card interface on the
HILTOP motherboard. Place close to the Raspberry Pi end of the interface.

6) Make ground planes continuous to board edge on top side where connectors are located, also make mounting holes all grounded and remove resistor link options, delete R148, R149, R150, R151 & C1

7) Add power supply circuit, U48 https://uk.farnell.com/nexperia/74lvc1g3157gv-125/mux-demux-2-1-sc-74-6/dp/2463921?st=74LVC1G3157

8) Expose unused USB channel 6 on USB2517 hub to vertical USB port on Motherboard (For internal use)

9) Changed footprint for Y1 for a smaller package (5x3.2mm)

**********************************
Changes incorporated in Rev D:
**********************************

1) Remove R201

2) Fit 10K 0603 to R202.

3) Cut track from R202 to 3.3V and re-route power to Vdd

4) Cut track from U40 (pin3) to +5V. Re-route to USB 5V power (pin 1) on J18

5) Fixed alignment issue on Backplane connector. Move to the left 2mm.

6) Add TVS diodes to main Power rails, D52, D53, D67 & D69

7) Swap connectors for fans, J21 & J23

8) Remove SD card ESD chip (U46) due to parts shortage

9) Update OHW license details

10) Swap Crystal Y1 due to parts availability
